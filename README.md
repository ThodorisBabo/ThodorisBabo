## Hi there! 👋

I’m **Thodoris**, a 25-year-old Electrical & Computer Engineering graduate, currently based in Greece.  

Right now, I’m finishing my **military service** and actively **looking for job opportunities** to kick-start my career as a software / machine learning engineer.

### These days I’m focused on:

- Machine Learning & data-driven projects   
- Improving my software engineering fundamentals

### Some stuff I built:

- **University ML Projects** – Classification, regression, and experimentation with real datasets  
- **Engineering Simulations** – Projects combining theory with code  
- **Personal Experiments** – Small projects built in my free time to explore ML concepts and tools  

### Fun facts:

- I like **sports** 🏀⚽  
- Big **anime fan** 🎌  
- Always curious about how things work under the hood
